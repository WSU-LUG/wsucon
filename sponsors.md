<p>We strive to make WSUCon a completely free event to all of our participants. Without the hard work of the Linux Users' Group and the generous donations of all of our sponsors, food, prizes, and other awesome goodies just wouldn't be possible.</p>

<p>Our event comes at a considerable cost, we are asking for your help through sponsoring the event! There are many ways to sponsor WSUCon, you could donate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your time that can be used to help with the planning and execution of WSUCon.</li>
    <li>Prizes for tournaments, raffles, etc...</li>
    <li>A meal for WSUCon so we don't starve during this amazing 24-hour event.</li>
    <li>Money that can go to any one of these various options (and equipment) depending on the needs of the Con.</li>
</ul>
