Given that we have a tight budget and food estimation is always tricky, seconds will open after everyone has been given the opportunity to get some food once.

                    <h4>PC Gamers</h4>
                    If you intend to play any PC games, in the tournaments or not, you will need to bring a computer capable of playing the games you want to participate in. This means everything, and read carefully!
                    <br>If your gaming rig is a <strong>tower</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tower</li>
                        <li>Monitor</li>
                        <li>Keyboard</li>
                        <li>Mouse</li>
                        <li>Power Cables for your desktop and monitor</li>
                        <li>Headphones (sorry, no speakers)</li>
                    </ul>
                    or if you're rolling with a good <strong>laptop</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Laptop</li>
                        <li>Power adapter</li>
                        <li>Mouse (unless you are a touchpad king)</li>
                        <li>Headphones</li>
                        <li>Cooling pad (if you have/need one)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Console Gamers</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Console</li>

                        No problem! We're really sorry you can't make it, but we totally understand. You should have gotten a confirmation email from EventBrite congratulating you on registering for WSUCon. Within that email, there should be a link to change registration and cancel. If you aren't able to find how to cancel or change your registration, please contact Daniel Zimmer at <a href="mailto:daniel.zimmer@wsu.edu">daniel.zimmer@wsu.edu</a>.
